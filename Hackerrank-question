Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:
print("Hello, World!")
You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:
my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
The above code will print Hello, World! on your screen. Try it yourself in the editor below!
Input Format
You do not need to read any input in this challenge.
Output Format
Print Hello, World! to stdout.
Sample Output 0
Hello, World!
--->>if __name__ == '__main__':
    print "Hello, World! "

Task Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions:
If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
Input Format
A single line containing a positive integer,n.
Constraints
1 <= n<= 100
Output Format
Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.
Sample Input 0
3
Sample Output 0
Weird
Explanation 0
n=3
n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so print Weird.
Sample Input 1
24
Sample Output 1
Not Weird
Explanation 1
n=24
n>20 and n is even, so it is not weird.
--->>#!/bin/python
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input().strip())
if n in range(2,6):
    if n%2==0:
        print("Not Weird")
    else:
        print("Weird")
elif n in range(6,21):
    n%2==0
    print("Weird")
elif n>20 and n%2==0:
    print("Not Weird")
else:
    print("Weird")
